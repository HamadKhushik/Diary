Transaction Isolation Levels:

1. READ-COMMITTED
        If there are multiple sessions accessing the database, all the other sessions will only see the committed changes in the database. (apart from the session making the changes). thats why its called READ-COMMITTED. it only reads the committed data!
        
2. READ-UNCOMMITTED 
        when multiple sessions are accessing the database and can see un-committed changes from other session is calles Read-UnCommitted. Its also called dirty read.
        
3. REPEATABLE-READ
        In this isolation level, the same data is seen within a session regardless of changes in other sessions. 'repeatable-read' i-e the data is repeated.
        
4. SERIALIZABLE
        This is the most strict leve of isolation. This would not even allow data to be read while it is being updated in other session. Even a select statement will lock the database from other sessions.
