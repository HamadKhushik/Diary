Four types of Drivers:
    - Type-1 Driver: Also known as bridge driver- acts as a bridge between Java             Application and ODBC. It is installed as part of Java JDK. Type-1 driver is Db     independent driver. It is slowest driver(low performance).
        - Type-1 Driver is platform dependent because it uses ODBC internally
        - It is not recommended to use Type-1 Driver since Java 1.8
    
    - Type-2 Driver: This driver converts Java specific calls to Vendor provided Db         specific Native libraries.
        - Relatively faster than Type-1 Driver
        - Type-2 Driver is platform dependent but can work with different platforms with platform specific libraries
        - It is Db dependent driver and platform dependent driver, because of these limitations, this is not recommended driver either
        - No guarantee that Db vendor provides Native libraries
        - OCI Driver is an example of Type-2 Driver which is provided by Oracle
        
    - Type-3 Driver: Also called as Middleware Driver
        - It is all Java Driver
        - Type-3 Driver converts Java(JDBC) specific calls to Middleware specific calls     which then converts the Middleware Specific calls to Db specific calls
        - Middleware Server internally uses Type-1, 2 or Type-4 Drivers
        - It is the most commonly used driver in Enterprise Applications
        - It is Db independent Driver
        - It is platform independent Driver
        - Performance is relatively low because of 2 conversions(JDBC => Middleware =>      Db)
        - Middleware Server must be installed, which is not ideal
        - This Driver is recommended for enterprise applications where multiple databases are in use
        
    - Type-4 Driver: It can directly communicate with the DB(unlike Type-1,2 or 3           Drivers)
        - It converts JDBC calls to Db call directly
        - Pure Java Driver coz it totally developed in Java and is platform             independent driver
        - It is also known as thin driver because no extra component is required to     communicate to Db
        - Only 1 conversion is required, therefore performance wise relatively better
        - It is a commonly used Driver
        - It is a Db dependent Driver
        - It is recommended for small scale or stand alone applications where only one   database is in use, as Type-4 is Db dependent
