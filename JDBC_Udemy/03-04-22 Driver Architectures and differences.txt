Thick and Thin Driver: 
    - The driver which needs an extra component to communicate with the Db is called     thick Driver. Examples of thick drivers are Type-1, 2 and Type-3 Drivers
    - Thin Driver is the one which does NOT need any extra component to communicate       with the DB. Example of thin Driver is Type-4 Driver
    
Tier2 vs Tier3 Architecture:
    In simplest terms, Here Tier means number of machines involved(for all the components) for complete call from Java Appliation to DB. 
    
    - Type-1 Driver is Tier2 Driver as Java Appliation & Type-1 Driver and ODBC Driver   are all based on client machine where as DB is on different machine. Hence         Tier2 Driver
    - Type-2 Driver is Tier2 Driver for the same reasons as above
    - Type-3 Driver is Tier3 Driver as Java Application and Type-3 Driver is based on     client machine, Middleware software is installed on different machine and Db is     based on a third machine. Hence Tier3 Driver
    - Type-4 Driver is as Tier2 Driver in the same way as Type-1 and Type-2 Drivers
    

Steps to Develop JDBC Application:
    - 1. Load and register Driver Class:
            - add .jar file for the driver in the class path
            - Class.ForName('Driver class name');
            - this step is not explicitly required after Java 1.6, its optional
    - 2. Establish connection between Java Application and Db
            - Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(jdbc url, username, pwd);
            - Breakdown of JDBC url = main-protcol: sub-protocol: sub-name
                                    =jdbc(always): driver_protocol: connection_details
            for Type-1 driver JDBC url = "jdbc:odbc:demodsn"
