Working with Type-2 Driver

    1. load ojdbc6.jar(for Oracle 11g which uses Java 6 internally) file to    classpath
    
    2. Driver Class Name: oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver
                        : oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver
    
    3. jdbc url= jdbc:oracle:oci8:@XE (until oracle 8v)
                 jdbc:oracle:oci:@XE (from oracle 9 onwards)
                 - where XE is SID(System ID) every Db has a unique SID which can be found by couple of ways (from SQL command prompt - select * from global_name)
