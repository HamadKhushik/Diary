Difference between core Java and Advanced Java
    - core Java can be used to develop stand alone applications, where as Advanced Java is required to develop web based applications
    
Technologies involved in Advanced Java include JDBC, Servlets and JSP.
    - JSP(Java Server Pages) is meant for presentation logic(to display web pages). JSP is used for developing view components. 
    
    - Servlets is used for processing logic. It acts as an intermediary between user-interface and DB. It gets requests from user and retrieves/validates/process the data from DB and returns to the user.
    
    - JDBC is the technology used to communicate with the DB by Java/Servlets.
    
    - Versions of JDBC, Servlets and JSP
        - JDBC = 4.2v
        - Servlets = 3.1v
        - JSP = 2.3v
    
Editions of Java
    - Java Standard Edition: (J2SE) this edition is mostly used to develop stand alone applications = Core Java + JDBC
    - Java Enterprise Edition: (J2EE) this edition is mostly used to develop web applicatoins = Servlets + JSP
    - Java Micro Edition: (J2ME) this edition is mostly used to develop mobile applications and embedded applications. This edition is mostly meant for micro devices eg remote controller etc
    
    
    
    
JDBC in simple way:
    Components of JDBC:
    - Driver (Acts as a translator between Java App and DB)
    - Connection
    - Statement Object
    - Result set
    
Steps to develop JDBC Application
    1. Load and register Driver
    2. Establish Connection between Java Application and DB
    3. Creation of Statement Object
    4. Send and execute SQL querry
    5. Process result from result set
    6. Close Connection
