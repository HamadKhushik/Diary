Connected MySQL to the AWS EC2 instance. Everytime EC2 instance is stopped and restarted its hostname changes, so make sure using the correct hostname before SSH-ing into the EC2 instance.
Practiced the CREATE and INSERT commands in the ECOMM_STORE database
Practiced the UPDATE command, updating multiple rows, using the WHERE clause in the update statement, updating severel rows at one time and using the CASE statement in the UPDATE command.
Practiced JOINS and DELETE commands.
learned about autocommit in MySQL and how to turn it off(set autocommit=0)

======================================================================================

SELECT statement structure
    SELECT --name/s of the required columns
    FROM -- table name OR joins if data need to be retrieved from multiple columns
    WHERE -- define the condition to narrow down the results
    ORDER BY -- how the data should be sorted - if required
    
it is also possible to use select statement with the functions as below
    SELECT NOW(), DATABASE() -- 

======================================================================================
    
UNION - it combines the results from two SELECT statements and returns all the unique           values.
    UNION ALL - return all the values including duplicates
    
    the syntax for union is as below
    
    SELECT c1 
    FROM T1 
    UNION 
    SELECT c1 
    FROM T2
    
======================================================================================
    
JOIN 
1.    inner join - it return only the values where the condition is met
    
    SELECT T1.c1, T2.c1
    FROM T1 INNER JOIN T2 ON T1.c1 = T2.c2;
    
    the above statement only returns the values from both the tables where T1.c1 = T2.c1
  
2. left join - it returns the values where the condition is met AND all the values in      the left column  
    SELECT T1.c1, T2.c1
    FROM T1 LEFT JOIN T2 ON T1.c1 = T2.c1
    
    the above statement will return all the values where the condition is met AND all the values in Table T1
    
3. right join - it returns the values where the condition is met AND all the values in      the right column
    
    SELECT T1.c1, T2.c1
    FROM T1 LEFT JOIN T2 ON T1.c1 = T2.c1
    
    the above statement will return all the values where the condition is met AND all the values in Table T2
    
4. full join - there is no full join in MySQL but it can be accomplished by using the       union statement

    SELECT T1.c1, T2.c1
    FROM T1 LEFT JOIN T2 ON T1.c1 = T2.c1
    UNION 
    SELECT T1.c1, T2.c1 
    FROM T1 RIGHT JOIN T2 ON T1.c1 = T2.c1
    
    this will return all the values in both the tables
